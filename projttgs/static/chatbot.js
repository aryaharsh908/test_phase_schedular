      answer: "**SmartScheduler** is an AI-powered automatic timetable generation platform built specifically for colleges, schools, and institutes.\n\n**The Problem We Solve:**\nCreating academic timetables manually takes weeks of painful back-and-forth — juggling teacher availability, room conflicts, lab slots, and workload balancing. Most coordinators dread it every semester.\n\n**Our Solution:**\nSmartScheduler uses a hybrid **Genetic Algorithm + Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** engine that generates a complete, clash-free, optimized timetable in just **3-8 seconds**. You simply input your departments, teachers, rooms, subjects, sections, and time slots — and the AI handles everything else.\n\n**What makes us different:**\n• Zero conflicts — guaranteed by hard constraint validation\n• Fair workload — AI distributes hours evenly across faculty\n• Lab-smart — handles 4-slot continuous labs with room-category matching\n• 9 solutions — choose the best from 9 optimized candidates\n• Edit after generation — add, swap, or substitute any slot\n• PDF export — one-click professional timetable downloads\n\nBuilt with ❤️ by Sanjeevan, Ishaanvi, Tushar & Pramod.\n📞 Questions?

      answer: "Here's exactly how SmartScheduler works — from start to finish:\n\n**📥 STEP 1: Input Your Data**\nYou enter (or CSV-import) all your academic data:\n• Departments (CS, IT, ECE, etc.)\n• Teachers with workload limits\n• Rooms & Labs with seating capacity and lab categories\n• Subjects linked to instructors\n• Sections (student batches) mapped to subjects\n• Time slots (9 per day, Monday-Friday)\n\n**🧠 STEP 2: AI Generation (3-8 seconds)**\nWhen you click 'Generate', the engine:\n① Creates 9 random timetable candidates (population)\n② Scores each one using a fitness function (fewer conflicts = higher score)\n③ Selects the best via tournament selection\n④ Crossover — combines the best schedules to create even better ones\n⑤ Mutation (5% rate) — introduces random changes to avoid getting stuck\n⑥ Repeats for multiple generations until optimization peaks\n⑦ (Optional) PSO refinement — fine-tunes with 25 swarm iterations for extra polish\n\n**🔒 What It Checks Automatically:**\n• No teacher teaching 2 classes at once\n• No room double-booked\n• No student section with overlapping classes\n• Labs only in matching lab rooms (electronics lab → electronics room)\n• Teacher workload within limits\n• Lunch break (Slot 5) always kept free\n• Max 2 consecutive classes per teacher\n• Compact student schedules with minimal gaps\n\n**📊 STEP 3: Pick Your Favorite**\nYou get 9 optimized solutions to browse — each is a complete valid timetable. Pick the one that suits your institution best.\n\n**✏️ STEP 4: Fine-Tune & Export**\nAfter saving, you can still edit individual slots, substitute teachers, or add/remove classes.

The engine tracks every teacher's schedule across all days and slots.\n\n🔴 **Room double-booking** — No two classes will ever be placed in the same room at the same time. Room occupancy is tracked per slot.\n\n🔴 **Section overlap** — Students in a section will never have two classes scheduled simultaneously.\n\n🔴 **Lab mismatch** — A chemistry subject will never be assigned to an electronics lab. Lab categories are strictly matched.\n\n🔴 **Workload overflow** — Teachers will never exceed their configured maximum hours.

No teacher gets overloaded while others sit idle.\n\n**🔬 Lab Intelligence:** 4-slot continuous lab blocks, category-matched rooms, parallel batch support. Labs actually work.\n\n**🎯 Choice:** 9 optimized solutions to choose from, not a single take-it-or-leave-it result.\n\n**✏️ Flexibility:** Edit any slot after generation. Substitute teachers in one click. Add or remove classes freely.\n\n**📤 Professional Output:** One-click PDF export ready for printing and distribution.\n\n**📥 Easy Setup:** CSV bulk import — set up your entire institution's data in minutes.\n\n**🌐 Zero Installation:** Runs entirely in your browser.
